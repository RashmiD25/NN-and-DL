This is a collection course learning from "[***Neural Networks and Deep Learning***](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)".
 * In this course, we learn the foundations of Deep Learning i.e;
        * Understanding the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
        * Being able to build, train and applying fully connected deep neural networks 
        * Knowing how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
        * Understanding the key parameters in a neural network's architecture
